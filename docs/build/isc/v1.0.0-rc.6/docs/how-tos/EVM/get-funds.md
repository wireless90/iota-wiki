There are multiple types of assets available on both IOTA L1 and L2, here we discuss a few of them, and how to get them
onto L2.

## Fund an Ethereum Account on a IOTA Smart Contracts Chain

To send EVM transactions, you need to have an Ethereum address that owns tokens on the ISC chain (L2). These tokens will
be used to cover gas fees.

### Firefly Wallet

You can use your [Firefly Wallet](https://firefly.iota.org/) to easily send L1 SMR to your L2 Shimmer EVM account. 

#### Requirements

* [Shimmer Tokens](/get-started/introduction/shimmer/shimmer-token/)
* [Firefly Wallet](https://firefly.iota.org/)
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

1. The first thing you will need to do is add Shimmer EVM to Metamask by hitting the following button.

    <AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={EVMNetworks['shimmerevm']}/>

2. Once you have added Shimmer EVM to Metamask, you can get your address:
